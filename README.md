# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Basic steps
 - we add image extractor extention (image assistant batch image ) and colorzilla
 - we exteract title icon 'favicon ' to in to ico converter
 - we download the image form pngimage.com
 - to control the conflext between overlaping the css class name we use bundle compnent means test.module.css
 - the we build the header part
 - then we add react responsive carousel
